					Construction Funding Access is a funding mechanism that bolsters its clients’ abilities to participate in large-scale public infrastructure projects, procurement contracts and other programs that require small business to carry project expenses for 60 days or more.<br><br><br>
					<b>CFA benefits small businesses by lending capital to cover the expenses associated with doing public sector construction projects including:</b><br>
					<b>1.</b> Outstanding accounts receivable;<br>
					<b>2.</b> Performance bond costs; and<br>
					<b>3.</b> Project mobilization and equipment<br><br><br>

					<b>CFA benefits prime contractors by:</b><br>
					<b>1.</b> Strengthening the reliability of sub-contractors via the prompt payment of invoices without impact to that
					prime’s cash position; and<br>
					<b>2.</b> Potentially providing an avenue for the prime to meet and exceed participation goals by processing and paying both SBE (Small Business Enterprise) and DBE (Disadvantage Business Enterprise) invoices through CFA as a certified DBE.<br>
					<b>3.</b> Significantly reducing the probability of inquiries or complaints from sub- contractors awaiting payment.<br>

					<h1>Why Construction Funding Access?</h1>
					<img src ="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/img/chart.jpg" class ="img-responsive "><br><br><br><br>
					This is accomplished by providing small primes and sub-contractors with easily accessible capital with favorable pricing without regard to their credit, tenure in business or underlying assets. Different than a factoring company, CFA takes into consideration the financial strength of the contracting entity and passes savings through to its small business clients.
